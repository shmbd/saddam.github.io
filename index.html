									<h2>About Me</h2>
									<p>My extensive wet lab research experience spans diverse projects in microbiology and biotechnology, focusing on applied and molecular microbiology. Currently, I am a researcher in the project “Development of Probiotic for Human Health,” where I focus on characterizing probiotic strains to enhance human health. As the Principal Investigator of the project “Whole Genome Analysis of Potential Probiotic Bacteria for the Treatment of Hypercholesterolemia,” I am utilizing cutting-edge molecular techniques to identify probiotic strains with therapeutic potential. Additionally, I serve as an Associate Investigator in the project “Isolation and Screening of Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) and Evaluation of Their Probiotic Potential for Anti-Obesity and Antioxidant Capacity,” which involves culturing, biochemical assays, and genetic analysis of LAB strains. My prior roles include being a Co-Investigator in the project “Screening and Characterization of Potential Microbes for Biotechnological Applications,” where I focused on isolating and characterizing microbial strains for industrial applications, employing techniques such as microbial culturing, enzyme assays, and metabolite analysis. During my tenure as a Lab Consultant in the NIB COVID-19 Detection Laboratory, I gained extensive hands-on experience in molecular diagnostics, including RNA extraction, RT-PCR, and biohazard management. My earlier projects included serving as Co-Investigator in the “Whole Genome Sequence of Hepatitis B Virus from a Patient in Bangladesh,” where I contributed to sequencing and analyzing viral genomes, and as a researcher in the project “Generation of Electricity Using Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC) from Sludge,” where I explored the electrochemical properties of microbes to generate bioelectricity. Collectively, these experiences have equipped me with a comprehensive skill set in microbiology and biotechnology, including microbial isolation, culturing, genomic analysis, molecular diagnostics, and bioinformatics, all integral to addressing complex scientific challenges.</p>
