								<p>I went through your website to learn about your work, and I found it extremely fascinating. With a strong background in microbiology, molecular biology, and biotechnology, I am eager to contribute to the investigation of blue light signaling in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and the opportunity to explore Phototropin signaling partners and their role in gene expression and photosynthetic efficiency aligns closely with my research interests and expertise.</p>
								<p>I hope this letter finds you well. I hope this letter finds you in good health. I am a Microbiology graduate currently employed as a Scientific Officer at the National Institute of Biotechnology (NIB), located in Dhaka, Bangladesh. I have completed my M.S. and B.S. from the Department of Microbiology, University of Dhaka, Bangladesh, and I am writing to express my sincere interest in joining your esteemed laboratory as a PhD student. </p>
